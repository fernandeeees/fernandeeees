# Hey 👋 I'm Fernandes

### About me: 
Currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at IST in Lisbon.

Working on front-end, embedded systems and graphics design at [PSEM Portugal](https://psemportugal.com/)

I'm constantly looking for ways to combine my drive for Software Engineering with my passion for arts and creativity.

If I'm not studying, you will certainly find me drawing, writing, getting better at the guitar, racing pretend cars in the simulator or real prototypes with PSEM 🏎️💨
